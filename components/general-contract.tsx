            <p>
              1) By signing his or her name to this Agreement and Terms and Conditions(this: "Agreement"), Home Owner
              authorizes In-Vision Construction LLC ("In-Vision Construction LLC") to communicate with Home Owner's
              Insurance Company ("Insurance Co.") regarding the damage to Home Owner's residence and the repairs related
              thereto. In-Vision Construction LLC shall consult with Home Owner's Insurance Company to determine extent
              of damage caused by a storm event and the repairs required to restore the residence to its pre-storm
              condition ("Scope of Work"). The Scope of Work shall be coordinated and performed by In-Vision
              Construction LLC and its contractors for the payment of a price agreeable to Insurance Co. (the "Price
              Agreeable"). In-Vision Construction LLC shall provide Home Owner with the final, approved Scope of Work
              and Price Agreeable prior to commencing any work. The final approved Scope of Work shall be attached
              hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. In-Vision Construction LLC hereby agrees to be bound to
              repair Scope of Work approved by Insurance Co. If In-Vision Construction LLC rejects a Scope of Work, or
              if the parties hereto cannot agree on a Scope of Work, this Agreement shall be deemed terminated that the
              parties shall have no further obligation to each other unless expressly set forth herein.
            </p>
            <p>
              2) In-Vision Construction LLC shall commence Work after your insurance company has approved the claim, and
              complete the Work within a build period starting from approximately April 1 and ending approximately
              October 31, subject to the remaining terms of this agreement, including but not limited to any force
              majeure events.
            </p>
            <p>
              3) Home Owner acknowledges that In-Vision Construction LLC as a general contractor and hereby authorizes
              Insurance Co. and/or Mortgage Co. above to make any checks payable jointly. In-Vision Construction LLC
              shall retain payment only for those items that Home Owner and In-Vision Construction LLC have agreed upon,
              regardless of damages for which Home Owner receives compensation from Insurance Co. Insurance Co. may
              include, offer, or reimburse Home Owner for certain repairs which are not included in the Scope of Work
              (the "Foregone Repairs"). Any Forgone Repairs are solely the responsibility of the Home Owner. In the
              event that the total amount of payment by Insurance Co. the exceeds the Price Agreeable, includes items
              not set forth in the Scope of Work, or includes any Foregone Repairs, In-Vision Construction LLC shall
              first apply any overage to Home Owner's out of pocket expenses and then shall pay the remaining amount of
